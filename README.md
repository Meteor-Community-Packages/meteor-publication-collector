# Publication Collector

[![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/johanbrook/meteor-publication-collector.svg?maxAge=2592000)]()

This package makes testing publications in Meteor easier and nicer.

Instead of resorting to exporting or exposing your publication functions for doing testing, this package lets you "subscribe" to a given publication and assert its returned results.

## Installation

```
meteor add johanbrook:publication-collector
```

## Usage

This package is server-only and can't be imported on the client.

```js
// server/myPublication.test.js

import { PublicationCollector } from 'meteor/johanbrook:publication-collector';

describe('myPublication', function() {
  it('should publish 10 documents', function(done) {
    const collector = new PublicationCollector({ userId: Random.id() });

    collector.collect('myPublication', firstPublicationArg, secondPublicationArg, (collections) => {
      assert.equal(collections.myCollection.length, 10);
      done();
    });
  });
});
```

### PublicationCollector

```js
const collector = new PublicationCollector(opts);
```

`opts` may have the following attributes:
- `userId`: Add a `this.userId` to the publication's context
- `delayInMs`: By default, `collect` callbacks are called when the publication is ready. If you use this option, the callbacks will be called `delayInMs` milliseconds after the publication is ready.

An instance of `PublicationCollector` also is an `EventEmitter`, and emits a `ready` event when the publication is marked as ready.

### PublicationCollector.collect -> Promise

```js
collector.collect(publicationName, [publicationArgs..., callback]);
```

- `publicationName (String)`:  the name of the publication (String)
- `publicationArgs`: zero or more arguments to the publication
- `callback (Function)`: Optional. The function to be called when the publication is ready. Will be called with a `collections` object.

Returns a Promise which resolves to a `collections` object.

The `collections` value is an object containing key:value pairs where the key is the name of a collection that the publication published and the value is an array of the documents that were published in that collection.

```js
collector.collect('myPublication', firstPublicationArg, secondPublicationArg, (collections) => {
  assert.equal(collections.myCollection.length, 10);
});
```

or use Promises:

```js
const collector = new PublicationCollector();

collector.collect('myPublication')
  .then(collections => {
    // assertions..
  })
  .catch(ex => /* error handling */);

// Or async/await style
const collections = await collector.collect('myPublication');
// assertions..
```

## Development

```
npm install
```

Follow `.eslintrc`

### Tests

Run tests once with

```
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode (in console) with

```
npm run test:dev
```

## History

This project was originally a part of MDG's [Todos](https://github.com/meteor/todos) example Meteor app, but later extracted as a separate test package.

Based on https://github.com/stubailo/meteor-rest/blob/devel/packages/rest/http-subscription.js.
